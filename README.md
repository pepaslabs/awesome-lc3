There is another variant, called the LC-3b, which is byte-addressable and adds bit shifting instructions.
Though there are PDFs available online of a few chapters describing the LC-3b, it appears these PDFs are from an as-yet unpublished version of "Introduction to Computing Systems".  See the ["Handouts" page](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/21s.460n/handouts.html) of the EE 460N course website.
